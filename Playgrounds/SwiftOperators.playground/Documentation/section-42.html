    <p>//# Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to manipulate the individual bits with a data structure. They are often used in low-level programming, such as graphics programming and device driver creation. Bitwise operators can also be useful when you work with raw data from external sources, such as encoding and decoding data for communication over a custom protocol. Swift supports all standard (~ - NOT, &amp; - AND, | - OR, ^ - XOR) bitwise operators.</p>

It inverts every bit in the given value. 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1. In case of a unsigned int, this operator returns a value of MAX - given value. If it is a UInt8 (8 bit integer), 255 - value is returned.</h1>
